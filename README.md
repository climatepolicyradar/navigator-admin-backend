# navigator-admin-backend

Backend for the Admin Pages

## Background

This repository along with the [frontend repository](https://github.com/climatepolicyradar/navigator-admin-frontend) forms the necessary components that make up the Admin Pages/Interface/Service.
These pages will provide the ability to edit Documents, Families, Collections and Events (DFCE).
At the moment an MVP is being worked on that will have limited functionality, the specification can be found on the CPR notion pages here:
[MVP Admin Interface](https://www.notion.so/climatepolicyradar/MVP-Admin-Interface-bf253a7ab30b4779a846d4322ca4c3f3).
Also on the notion pages is the [Admin API Specification](https://www.notion.so/climatepolicyradar/Admin-API-Specification-2adecc8411324b8181e05184fc6a5431#8da09a31c3f244e6a5acfacc9dfd9e2f).
